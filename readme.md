# Goal Tracker

This is a ruby project with SQL using PostgreSQL.

It allows you to create players, create games, and add them into a goals "join" table.

By adding a goal to a player, you are able to then see the information from the join table.

This project completed by Randy Leighton for a solo assessment.
